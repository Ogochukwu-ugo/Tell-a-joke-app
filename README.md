This is an API classwork, where we learnt about API calling and  how to fetch data from an API.
The Tell a Joke app, is a simple app that allows a user to fetch joke from a random joke api by clicking on buttons, and after reading, the user clicks on the reset button, to reset the page to it's original state.

I also included some lines of codes which can reset the page after few mintues of reading the joke, but I commented it out because the task stated that we incluude a reset button to the app.
